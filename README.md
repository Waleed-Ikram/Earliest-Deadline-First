# Earliest-Deadline-First
This is the code for implementing the Earliest Deadline First algorithm in C++. 
Command Line graphics have also been included for this algorithm so you can run and test it.
This algorithm takes as input the execution time and period for all the processes and at the end 
gives the schedule along with time stamps.
